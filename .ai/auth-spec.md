# Authentication and Authorization Technical Specification

This document outlines the architecture for user registration, login, logout, and password recovery as per the Security requirements in the PRD and according to the tech stack guidelines.

## 1. UI Architecture

### Frontend Pages and Layouts
- **Authentication Pages:**  
  - Create dedicated Astro pages (e.g., `/src/pages/signin.astro`, `/src/pages/signup.astro`, `/src/pages/password-recovery.astro`).  
  - These pages are server-rendered to ensure secure handling of user inputs and to manage redirection for authenticated vs. unauthenticated users.
  
- **Protected Page Middleware:**  
  - Implement middleware in `/src/middleware/index.ts` to verify user sessions (via Supabase token from `context.locals`).  
  - Redirect unauthenticated users to the sign-in page when accessing restricted routes (e.g., groups and flashcards views).

### Components
- **Header Component:**  
  - Present on all subpages, with a conditional logout button in the top right corner, visible only when a user is authenticated.
  
- **Form Components:**  
  - Use React functional components (located in `/src/components`) for interactive forms (registration, login, and password recovery).  
  - Validate fields both client-side (using React hooks) and server-side (using Zod schemas).  
  - Display feedback and error messages near the input fields.

### Validation and Error Handling
- **Field Validation:**  
  - Check required fields (email, password, password confirmation) immediately on the client.  
  - Enforce strong password requirements: minimum of 8 characters, including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.  
  - On form submission, perform further validation on the server with Zod, returning localized error messages.
  
- **Error Handling Scenarios:**  
  - Invalid credentials for login.  
  - Mismatched or weak passwords during signup.  
  - Non-existent email or rate-limited requests in password recovery.
  - Ensure graceful error messages and user guidance on failure.

## 2. Backend Logic

### API Endpoints
- **Endpoint Structure:**  
  - Create endpoints within `/src/pages/api/auth` for handling:
    - `POST /api/register` – for new user registration.
    - `POST /api/login` – to authenticate existing users.
    - `POST /api/logout` – to destroy user sessions.
    - `POST /api/password-recovery` – to process password recovery requests.
  
- **Technical Details:**
  - Each endpoint uses Supabase Auth (accessed via `context.locals.supabase`) to execute appropriate actions.
  - Utilize Zod for validating request bodies early in each endpoint to prevent invalid data processing, including password strength validation.
  - Use try-catch blocks to ensure proper exception handling with clear error logging.
  - Return structured JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 400/401 for validation or authorization errors).

### Server-Side Rendering Considerations
- **Astro Integration:**  
  - Maintain SSR for authentication pages to leverage the configuration from `astro.config.mjs` (using `output: "server"` and experimental session support).  
  - Ensure pages rely on secure handling of cookies via `Astro.cookies` and server-side session tokens from Supabase.

## 3. Authentication System

### Supabase Auth Integration
- **Authentication Workflow:**  
  - On registration, use Supabase's createUser API to register new users and validate using email, password, and password confirmation as per the defined rules.
  - For login, use Supabase's signInWithPassword and retrieve a session token that is stored in the user’s cookie.
  - For logout, call Supabase signOut functionality and remove credentials from cookies.
  - For password recovery, call Supabase resetpasswordForEmail.
  
- **Security Considerations:**  
  - Protect endpoints with proper authentication checks and utilize early returns for missing or invalid sessions.
  - Maintain clear separation between server-side logic (Astro pages/API routes) and client-side interactivity (React components and forms).
  - Log security-related events and adhere to best practices in error handling and data validation.

## Conclusion

This specification provides a comprehensive architecture for integrating user registration, login, logout, and password recovery, ensuring:

- Secure mechanisms via SSR and Supabase Auth integration.
- Clear and enforceable password requirements as specified in the PRD.
- Seamless user experience with clear feedback in authentication flows.
- Effective division of responsibilities between Astro and React components.
- Robust error handling and data validation via Zod on both client and server.
  
Implement this plan by creating/updating the appropriate Astro pages, React components, API endpoints, and middleware as described.
