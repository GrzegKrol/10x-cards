1. Flashcards entity will include: front, back, creation_date, updated_date, is_generated_by_ai, is_approved (boolean), user_id, and group_id.
2. User entity consists solely of username and password_hash (both limited to 100 characters).
3. FlashcardsGroup entity will include: id, name, creation_date, updated_date, last_used_prompt, and last_used_cards_count, with the relation that a user can have many groups.
4. All primary keys will use UUIDs.
5. The front and back fields in Flashcards are limited to a maximum of 100 characters each.
6. Indexes will be added on user_id, group_id, and updated_date.
7. Row Level Security will rely on the Supabase mechanism.
</decisions>

<matched_recommendations>
1. Define separate tables for User, FlashcardsGroup, and Flashcards with UUID primary keys.
2. Establish relationships where a User has many FlashcardsGroups, and each FlashcardsGroup has many Flashcards, ensuring each Flashcard belongs to one group and each group belongs to one user.
3. Apply constraints on text fields (front, back, and password_hash) to enforce a 100-character limit.
4. Create indexes on foreign key columns (user_id and group_id) and on the creation_date column for performance.
5. Implement RLS using the built-in Supabase security mechanisms to restrict data access to the owner.

<database_planning_summary>
The planned database schema for the MVP includes three main entities: User, FlashcardsGroup, and Flashcards. The User entity contains a username and a hashed password (both restricted to 100 characters), serving as the owner of FlashcardsGroup records. The FlashcardsGroup entity holds group details including its name, creation_date, updated_date, the last prompt used, and the last card count, establishing a one-to-many relationship with Flashcards. The Flashcards entity records individual flashcards with fields for front, back (each limited to 100 characters), creation_date, updated_date, flags for AI generation (is_generated_by_ai) and approval (is_approved), and foreign keys linking to both User and FlashcardsGroup. UUIDs are employed as primary keys across all tables. Indexes are recommended on user_id, group_id, and creation_date to enhance query performance. Security and data isolation will leverage Supabase's built-in Row Level Security.
